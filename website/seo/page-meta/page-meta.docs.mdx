import { PageMeta } from "./page-meta.js";

### About

Component that wraps around the `<head>` of a HTML document, enabling the ability to add meta tags,
and any other tags that can be placed in the head of a HTML file.

This component provides an easy interface for being able to render HTML head and body elements,
which means that you can add meta content based on your requirements.

### Component usage

Use the `<PageMeta/>` component in conjunction with the
[Page](https://bit.dev/teambit/blog/layout/page) component to get its full benefit.

```js
<PageMeta>
  <meta property="twitter:site" name="twitter:site" content="@bitdev_" />
</PageMeta>
```

Use in conjunction with `<Page/>` if you want to be able to render HTML `<head>` children and
`<body>` children.

_*Note: Elements inside of `<PageMeta>` will not be visible*_

```js
<Page>
  <PageMeta>
    <meta property="twitter:site" name="twitter:site" content="@bitdev_" />
  </PageMeta>
  <div>
    <p>Hey there!</p>
  </div>
</Page>
```

The PageMeta component accepts two optional props: title and description. This provides an interface
whereby you can either pass as props, or pass them as children. Both of the following examples would
produce the same output:

```jsx
<PageMeta title="About" description="This is where you can learn more about our website" />
```

```jsx
<PageMeta>
    <title>About</title>
    <meta name="description" content="This is where you can learn more about our website">
</PageMeta>
```
